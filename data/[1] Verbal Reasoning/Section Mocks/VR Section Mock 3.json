Enzymes can be named by adding the suffix -ase to the name of the substrate that they modify (i.e., urease and tyrosinase), or the type of reaction they catalyse (dehydrogenase, decarboxylase). Some have arbitrary names (e.g trypsin). The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology assigns each enzyme a name and a number to identify them. Enzymes are classified into six categories according to the type of reaction catalysed: Oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, ligases, and isomerases. Structurally, the vast majority of enzymes are proteins.Also RNA molecules have catalytic activity(ribozymes).Coenzymes are small nonprotein molecules that are associated to some enzymes.Many coenzymes are related to vitamins.Coenzymes and the protein portion with catalytic activity or apoenzyme form the holoenzyme.
