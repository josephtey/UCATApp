In the Northern Hemisphere, there’s the Sahara, the American Southwest, the Arabian Desert, the Lut Desert and the Thar Desert. These deserts all have something in common — they exist at or near 30° latitude. The reason for this similarity is due to a system of 'air conveyor belts 'which move vast amounts of air in the Earth’s upper atmosphere. The conveyor belt responsible for these deserts is known as the Hadley Cell. <br/>The Earth receives massive amounts of sunlight every day, and the equator receives more sunlight than anywhere else on the planet. This vast amount of sunlight creates a lot of heat. Since hot air rises, the air at the equator will rise high up into the earth’s atmosphere after being heated by the sun. From there, it’s carried northward where it begins to cool. After sufficient cooling, it begins to fall back down towards the ground. This system of rising and falling air is the Hadley Cell. When the warm air rises at the equator, it’s filled with a lot of moisture and water vapor. As that vapor-rich air continues to rise, it’s free to expand in the lower pressure atmosphere. This expansion also slightly cools the warm air. This change causes the moisture within the air to condense which results in heavy rains. This process is the reason why there tends to be a lot of rain near the equator and is why the tropics are so wet. <br/>The air hasn’t finished its journey, however. Now dry as a bone, the warm air continues its journey and follows the Hadley cell convection belt. Once that dry air has cooled enough, it descends. This descent happens at ± 30° latitude. If the region has no other source of moisture, either from local weather climates or interactions with other weather systems, the area will dry out and eventually become a desert.",

Perhaps the most virulent occurrence came in the mid 1300s with the black death, which felled more than 20 million people across Europe alone. While it’s largely believed that bacteria-carrying fleas were the main culprit, 'experts' at the time found other explanations—especially in astrology and broadly formed ideas of noxious vapors as a breeding ground for pestilence. <br/>In 1348, for example, King Philip VI of France asked the greatest medical minds at the University of Paris to report back to him on the causes of the bubonic plague. In a detailed document submitted to the crown, they blamed 'the configuration of the heavens.' Specifically, they wrote that, in 1345, 'at one hour after noon on 20 March, there was a major conjunction of three planets [Saturn, Mars and Jupiter] in Aquarius.' Adding to that, they noted, a lunar eclipse occurred around the same time. <br/>Citing ancient philosophers such as Albertus Magnus and aristotle, the Parisian medical scholars went on to connect the dots between planets and pestilence: 'For Jupiter, being wet and hot, draws up evil vapors from the earth and Mars, because it is immoderately hot and dry, then ignites the vapors, and as a result there were lightning, sparks, noxious vapors and fires throughout the air.' Terrestrial winds, they went on, spread the noxious airs widely, smiting down 'the life force' of anyone who ingested it into their lungs: 'This corrupted air, when breathed in, necessarily penetrates to the heart and corrupts the substance of the spirit there and rots the surrounding moisture, and the heat thus caused destroys the life force, and this is the immediate cause of the present epidemic. <br/>A few centuries later, those noxious vapors were given another label: 'miasma.' If it smelled bad, people reasoned, it must carry disease. That explains why, during the plague of 1665, some doctors donned beak-shaped masks filled with sweet-smelling flowers—to protect themselves from infection.",

Out of all of the industries that technology plays a crucial role in, healthcare is definitely one of the most important. This merger is responsible for improving and saving countless lives all around the world. <br/>Medical technology is a broad field where innovation plays a crucial role in sustaining health. Areas like biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, information technology, the development of medical devices and equipment, and more have all made significant contributions to improving the health of people all around the world. From small innovations like adhesive bandages and ankle braces, to larger, more complex technologies like MRI machines, artificial organs, and robotic prosthetic limbs, technology has undoubtedly made an incredible impact on medicine. <br/>In the healthcare industry, the dependence on medical technology cannot be overstated, and as a result of the development of these brilliant innovations, healthcare practitioners can continue to find ways to improve their practice – from better diagnosis, surgical procedures, and improved patient care. As technology in the world of healthcare continues to evolve, rules and regulations concerning its use must be established and adjusted to adapt to the new methods of administering care. <br/>Regulations like HIPAA and its Privacy and Security Act target the concerns about the confidentiality of patient information and the steps that must be taken to maintain privacy in our digital world. Medical providers and healthcare administration must be careful when choosing to implement new products and technologies into their services and should ensure that all technologies are 'HIPAA compliant' before investing in their implementation. Other initiatives, like the 2010 Health Care Reform bill, state the steps that must be taken by hospitals and other care providers to integrate medical technology into their practices.",

Experts say they have discovered bubbles of carbon dioxide trapped in volcanic rocks dating to the end of the Triassic, backing up the theory that such activity contributed to the greenhouse climate that is believed to have been behind the mass extinction. This biotic crisis wiped out almost half of the existing species of the late Triassic in both marine and terrestrial realms, said Manfredo Capriolo of the University of Padova in Italy, a co-author of the study. <br/>While Capriolo noted the end-Triassic mass extinction has long been known to have been caused by extreme climate change, and that there was large-scale volcanic activity at the time, he said it had been unclear whether the volcanic activity directly contributed to the extinction event. Among other possibilities, he said, it could have been that magma caused the emission of gases as it flowed into shallow sediments.<br/>The new work, said Capriolo, shows that carbon dioxide released directly by volcanic activity would indeed have made a large contribution to the devastating climate change of the time. Indeed the team say the amount of carbon emissions released in a single pulse of eruptions – which would have resulted in about 100,000 km3 of lava being spewed forth over 500 years – is on a par with the total expected to be produced by human activity over the 21st century, assuming a 2C rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels. <br/>That, they say, offers a sobering warning for today. [This] suggests that the end - Triassic climatic and environmental changes, driven by CO2 emissions, may have been similar to those predicted for the near future, the team write.",

Working at scales defined in millionths of a millimetre, Richard Smalley, Robert Curl and Harold Kroto reported the discovery of ‘buckminsterfullerene’ – a nanosized polyhedron, with 32 faces fused into a cage-like, soccer-ball structure, and with carbon atoms sitting in each of its 60 vertices. These miniature ‘Bucky’ balls (named for their similarity to the geodesic dome structures made by the architect R Buckminster Fuller in the 1950s), are found in tiny quantities in soot, in interstellar space and in the atmospheres of carbon-rich red giant stars, but Kroto was able to recreate them in chemical reactions in the lab while visiting Rice University in Texas. Then, in 1991, Nadrian Seeman’s lab at New York University used 10 artificial strands of DNA to create the first human-made nanostructure, connecting up the DNA strands to resemble the edges of a cube, so marking the beginning of the field now known as ‘DNA nanotechnology’. Clever scientists with broad visions started to realise that a new kind of technology, prophesied by Richard Feynman in the 1950s, was finally materialising, as researchers achieved the capacity to visualise, fabricate and manipulate matter at the nanometre scale. <br/>The term nanotechnology was coined in 1974 by the Japanese scientist Norio Taniguchi to describe semiconductor processes involving engineering at the nanoscale, but it entered public debate only with the publication of K Eric Drexler’s influential Engines of Creation (1986), a hyperbolic book of futuristic scientific imaginings of what might be achieved on the scale of the unimaginably small. Drexler’s book sparked longlasting controversies, notably focused on the weak scientific grounding of some of his ideas; but nothing stuck more to the public consciousness than his prediction of a hypothetical ‘grey goo’, scourge of a global dystopia involving out-of-control self-replicating machines devouring all life on Earth.",

These plants are able to bend, twist and reposition their stems to ensure that they reproduce. But others such as buttercups fail to bounce back after damage. The remarkable abilities of some flowers to recover quickly from serious injury, have been previously overlooked by science, say the authors of this new work. <br/>Researchers looked at 23 native and cultivated flower species in the UK, Europe, Australia and North and South America. They examined species which had suffered accidents and they also carried out experiments where the flowers were tethered at either 45 or 90 degrees off their normal orientation. For many flowers, their ability to reproduce depends on the careful alignment of their sexual organs or stigma and their nectar tubes in order for a visiting pollinator to help them make seeds. The scientists found that when these species were damaged, they could accurately reposition their sexual organs. <br/> The common spotted orchid does it largely by just bending the main stem, said Prof Scott Armbruster from the University of Portsmouth who led the research. It's pretty quick, within a day or two, it's reoriented its main stem so that now all the flowers are in the right position, he told BBC News. The slightly more interesting ones were where each individual flower re - orients on its own, by the sub stem, that's what's called the pedicel connecting the flower to the main stem, and that is bending or twisting.And that 's what you see with aconitum.<br/>These rapid recovering species were usually bilaterally symmetrical flowers, which is where the left- and right-hand sides mirror each other. Examples of these types of flowers include snapdragon, orchid and sweet pea.",

In all, eight major Crusade expeditions occurred between 1096 and 1291. The bloody, violent and often ruthless conflicts propelled the status of European Christians, making them major players in the fight for land in the Middle East. By the end of the 11th century, Western Europe had emerged as a significant power in its own right, though it still lagged behind other Mediterranean civilizations, such as that of the Byzantine Empire (formerly the eastern half of the Roman Empire) and the Islamic Empire of the Middle East and North Africa. <br/>However, Byzantium had lost considerable territory to the invading Seljuk Turks. After years of chaos and civil war, the general Alexius Comnenus seized the Byzantine throne in 1081 and consolidated control over the remaining empire as Emperor Alexius I. <br/>In 1095, Alexius sent envoys to Pope Urban II asking for mercenary troops from the West to help confront the Turkish threat. Though relations between Christians in the East and West had long been fractious, Alexius’s request came at a time when the situation was improving. In November 1095, at the Council of Clermont in southern France, the Pope called on Western Christians to take up arms to aid the Byzantines and recapture the Holy Land from Muslim control. This marked the beginning of the Crusades. Pope Urban’s plea was met with a tremendous response, both among the military elite as well as ordinary citizens. Those who joined the armed pilgrimage wore a cross as a symbol of the Church.",

Poleward shifts in the geographic distributions of species, catastrophic forest fires and mass bleaching of coral reefs all bear the fingerprints of climate change. But what will the world’s biodiversity look like in the future? <br/>Projections indicate that unless emissions are rapidly reduced the climate crisis will get substantially worse. Up to 50% of species are forecast to lose most of their suitable climate conditions by 2100 under the highest greenhouse gas emissions scenario. <br/>But we still lack answers to some basic questions. When will species be exposed to potentially dangerous climate conditions? Will this occur in the next decade or only later in the century? Will the exposure of species accumulate gradually, one species at a time? Or should we expect abrupt jumps as the climate limits of multiple species are exceeded? Our understanding of when and how abruptly climate driven disruptions of biodiversity will occur is limited because biodiversity forecasts typically focus on individual snapshots of the future. We took a different route. We used annual projections of temperature and precipitation from 1850 to 2100 across more than 30,000 marine and terrestrial species to estimate the timing of species exposure to potentially dangerous climate conditions<br/>Based on these projections, we estimate that climate change could cause sudden biodiversity losses. These could occur much sooner this century than had been expected. This new analysis indicates that a high percentage of species in local ecosystems could be exposed to potentially dangerous climate conditions simultaneously. Rather than slowly sliding down a climate change slope, many ecosystems face a cliff edge.",

The robotic arm is capable of movement in much the same way as a human arm with an elbow and wrist and can place instruments directly up against rock and soil targets of interest. In the mechanical ‘fist’ of the arm is a microscopic camera that serves the same purpose as a geologist's handheld magnifying lens.The Rock Abrasion Tool serves the purpose of a geologist 's rock hammer to expose the insides of rocks.",

But efforts to curb the spread of the virus might mean that the planet itself is moving a little less. Researchers who study Earth’s movement are reporting a drop in seismic noise — the hum of vibrations in the planet’s crust — that could be the result of transport networks and other human activities being shut down. They say this could allow detectors to spot smaller earthquakes and boost efforts to monitor volcanic activity and other seismic events. <br/>A noise reduction of this magnitude is usually only experienced briefly around Christmas, says Thomas Lecocq, a seismologist the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels, where the drop has been observed. Just as natural events such as earthquakes cause Earth’s crust to move, so do vibrations caused by moving vehicles and industrial machinery. And although the effects from individual sources might be small, together they produce background noise, which reduces seismologists’ ability to detect other signals occurring at the same frequency.If lockdownscontinue inthe coming months,city - based detectors around the world might be better than usual at detecting the locations of earthquake aftershocks,says Andy Frassetto,a seismologist at the Incorporated Research Institutionsfor Seismology in Washington DC.The fall in noise could also benefit seismologists who use naturally occurring background vibrations,such as those from crashing ocean waves,to probe Earth’ s crust.Because volcanic activity and changing water tables affect how fast these natural waves travel,scientists can study these events by monitoring how long it takes a wave to reach a given detector.A fall in human - induced noise could boost the sensitivity of detectors to natural waves at similar frequencies,says Lecocq,whose team plans to begin testing this. 'There’s a big chance indeed it could lead to better measurements,' he says.",
