In recent reviews of the standard, EPA has determined that even short-term exposure to high levels of SO2 can have a detrimental effect on breathing function, particular for those that suffer from asthma. SO2 also reacts with other chemicals in the air to form tiny sulfate particles, contributing to levels of particulate matter. SO2 also reacts with other chemicals in the air to form acids, which fall to the earth as acid rain. Acid rain damages forests and crops, changes the makeup of soil, and makes lakes and streams acidic and unsuitable for fish.<br/>Source: https://www.pca.state.mn.us/air/sulfur-dioxide ",

Lithium-ion batteries are commonly used for portable electronics and electric vehicles and are growing in popularity for military and aerospace applications. In the batteries, lithium ions move from the negative electrode through an electrolyte to the positive electrode during discharge, and back when recharging. Li-ion batteries use a lithium compound as the material at the positive electrode and typically graphite at the negative electrode. The batteries have a high energy density, no memory effect and low self-discharge. They can however be a safety hazard since they contain a flammable electrolyte, and if damaged or incorrectly charged can lead to explosions and fires. Samsung was forced to recall Galaxy Note 7 handsets following lithium-ion fires, and there have been several incidents involving batteries on Boeing 787 planes.",
