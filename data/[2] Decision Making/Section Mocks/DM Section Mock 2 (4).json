If we multiply this equation by 8 (to sub into (3)), then we get 8r + 8p = 400. Subbing 8r + 8p into (3), we get 400 + 2b = ?. Therefore, we can now guess the correct answer by eliminating the options we have. We know it cannot be 400, because 400 + 2b has to be greater than 400 (as b is not 0). We know it cannot be 536 as 2b cannot equal 136 (since equation (2) = 136 as a whole). Between B and C, B seems more reasonable and for C to be correct, 2b would have to equal 83, and since equation (1) equals 86, it is impossible for 2b = 83. Therefore, the correct answer is B, 416.

              "explanation": "If the probability of tossing a 5 than not tossing a 5 (ie. tossing a 1,2,3,4,6) is 4 times greater, then we can say that the probability of tossing a 5 is 4/5, and the probability of not tossing a 5 is 1/5. We can also conclude that the probability of getting a 2 out of the 5 different non-5 numbers (1,2,3,4,6) is 1/5. So overall, the probability of tossing a 2 is 1/5 * 1/5 = 1/25 (you have to first ‘not toss a five’, and then you have to also ‘toss a 2’ essentially). In other words, the probability of tossing each of the 6 numbers is as follows: 1 = 1/25, 2 = 1/25, 3 = 1/25, 4 = 1/25, 5 = 4/5, 6 = 1/25. If you add up all these fractions, you get 1, and if you add up all the probabilities for ‘non-5’ numbers, you will get 1/5. So if we make 1/25 and 4/5 into common denominators, we get 4/100 and 80/100 respectively. Thus we can conclude that tossing a 5 is 20 times more likely than tossing a 2. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",
