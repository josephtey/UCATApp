In the United Kingdom, most schools are publicly funded and known as state schools or maintain schools in which tuition is provided for free – there is no mention of ‘public schools’, only ‘state schools’ or ‘maintained schools’. Thus we do not know if tuition is free in public schools, and we know that some expensive private schools are known as public schools (in which case tuition is not free). Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>2. We do not know anything about the existence or non-existence of private schools in North America. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>3. The passage states that “there are also private schools or independent schools that charge fees” – thus we can infer that private and independent schools are different things that both charge fees (or at least we cannot be sure that they are the same thing). Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>4.

We do not know whether private schools that charge fees are not publicly funded, we have no information about their public funding or if it exists or does not exist.

Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>3. While the kidneys make up 0.4% which is less than the 31% under ‘remaining’, we do not know if there are smaller parts of the body under ‘remaining’ which account for less than 0.4% of the body’s weight. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>4. As we only have the average body weight of 80kg as a guide, we can’t say for sure whether it is a possibility or not. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>5. Brain weight = 2%, whereas heart + kidneys = 0.9%. This, the brain occupies more of the average body’s weight that the heart and kidneys combined. Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.",

Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.<br/>5. Difference between France and United Kingdom populations = 12.8 – 12.3 = 0.5%. Thus, the difference in terms of people would = 0.005*200 million = 1 million people less in the United Kingdom compared to France. Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.",

Time spent on Social Networking in March 2018 = 0.47*3.2 billion = 1.504 billion hours. Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.<br/>3. The most popular online activity would have been Social Networking instead (higher percentage than videos). Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>4. The percentage of time usage on reading online was the same in both months (3%), however, the overall time spent online increased by 1.2 billion hours, so therefore we can tell that more time was spent on reading in March 2018 than 2016. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>5. The percentage of time usage on gaming online was the same in both months (13%), and since the total time spent online increased by 1.2 billion hours, we can tell that more time was spent gaming online in March 2018 than 2016.

The column between 250 and 300cm is the highest of all the columns, so by observation we can say that a greater number of trees between 250-300cm grew than any other height range. Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.<br/>2. We do not know if there are no trees that are 400cm in general, all we can say is that there are none in this graph. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>3. Since there are 4+30+26+50+11 = 121 trees approximately in this graph, the median tree height would be the 61st tree (121/2 = 60.5 = 61). Thus, we can say that the 61st tree would fall in the range of the 250-300cm, which means this statement is still true (there may be some discrepancy in the number of trees calculated to be in the 100-150cm and 200-250cm range, hence the wider range given in the statement). Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.<br/>4. Around 11 trees grew to 300-350cm tall, whereas only around 4 grew to 100-150cm tall. Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.<br/>5. Approximately 4+30+26+50+11 = 121 trees were measured (give or take 1 to 3 trees, but definitely not 130).

Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>2. From 1931-1970, the Netherlands supplied the US with the most immigrants. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>3. Of the four countries shown, this statement may be true, however we do not know if the US received immigrants from countries other than these 4 Northern European countries or not, so we cannot say for sure that the US received the most immigrants from Sweden during this time. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>4. Again, we do not know if the US received immigrants from countries other than the 4 Northern European countries in the graph or not, so we cannot say that this statement is true for sure. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>5. The approximate number of Northern European immigrants to the US from 1921-30 would be less than 300,000, since the combined number of immigrants from Denmark and the Netherlands is less than 100,000 (this is by observation, since neither is equal to or larger than 50,000). Thus, since the number of immigrants from Norway is less than 100,000 but greater than 50,000, and the number of immigrants from Sweden = 100,000, we know the total number of Northern European immigrants is somewhere between 250,000-300,000.

We can tell by observation (rather than calculating which might take a while), that the median time would be somewhere between 90 to 110mins, as the columns form a sort of symmetrical shape with the two middle columns being the highest. Thus, is it impossible for the median to be in the 80-90mins category. Therefore, the correct answer is NO, as the conclusion does not follow.<br/>3. People requiring help for 50-60mins = 105. People requiring help for 130-140mins = 271. Thus, 271/2 = 135.5, which is greater than 105 people. Therefore, the correct answer is YES, as the conclusion does follow.<br/>4. Instead of adding all the columns together, we can estimate that less than 2000 people required help for 90-110mins, and around just more than 2000 people required help for 70-90mins and 110-130mins combined.
