Therefore, we know Kris will reach school first (for them to arrive at the same time, Manny would have to be running faster at 18km/h, or Kris be running slower at 7.5km/h). Now we only need to calculate Kris’ time: using the formula speed = distance/time, or s = d/t, we can transpose this to t = d/s, and just sub in the values we have. So t = 5/9 = 0.555…hrs, which in terms of minutes would be 0.555…*60 = 33.3333 minutes. Thus, he would have to arrive at 8:34am (not rounded down to 8:33am because he would still have 20 seconds to go). Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
