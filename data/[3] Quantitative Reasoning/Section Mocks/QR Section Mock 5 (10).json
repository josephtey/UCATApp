However in terms of the length, we can only fit two pieces, as the length is 3cm per piece and the total cake length is 7cm, meaning we have 1cm of cake length leftover but we cannot use that to cut a piece of the same dimensions. Thus, we can cut 2*3 = 6 pieces from the cake in total (with the same dimensions as the model, 3*2). Since we have already cut 1, we can therefore cut 5 more. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
