              "answer": "B",
              "explanation": "To calculate the area of the trapezium you can break it up into a rectangle and 2 triangles (essentially another rectangle): so (45 * 20) + (7.5 * 20) = 1,050. Now to find the volume, we could multiply 1,050 by 80, but since we are only finding half the volume, we only need to multiply by 40. Therefore 1,050 * 40= 42,000 cm^3. Therefore, the answer is B. ",

Since we are dealing with volume, each dimension needs to be reduced by the same amount to maintain the ratio of dimensions, each side needs to be reduced by 10 (since 103 = 1,000). Thus, 80/10 = 8cm. Therefore, the answer is C.",

The length is the same as the bottom part at 80cm. Therefore the volume of this prism is (0.5*45*20) * 80 = 36,000cm^3 (this is the area of the triangle multiplied by the length).
