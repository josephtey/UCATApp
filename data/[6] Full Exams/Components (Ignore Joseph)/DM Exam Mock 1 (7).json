The reason equation (2) has 3.5c is because she leaves half the cartons unused, so essentially she puts 7 eggs in half the cartons, which mathematically looks like 7*(c/2), which we can simplify to 3.5c. Now we can just equate (1) and (2) and solve for c, so that 4c + 2 = 3.5c + 5, so that c = 6. Therefore by subbing c = 6 into (1), we know that she has 26 eggs. If she fills the cartons with 5 eggs each, that means she needs 30 eggs. Therefore, 30 – 26 = 4, she needs 4 more eggs. Therefore, the correct answer is C. ",
