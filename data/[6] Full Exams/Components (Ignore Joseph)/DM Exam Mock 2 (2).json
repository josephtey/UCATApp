We can convert (1) and (2) to 2p = 40 – 2y – 2g, and 2p = 50 – 3y – 3g. Using simultaneous equations, we can equate these rearranged equations to 40 – 2y – 2g = 50 – 3y – 3g, and simplify the equation so that 10 = y + g. Now we can multiple this by 2 so we get 20 = 2y + 2g, and substitute this into (1) so that 20 + 2p = 40, so therefore p = 10. We can also multiple 10 = y + g by 5 to get 50 = 5y + 5g to substitute into the last equation, so that 50 + 3p = ?. Since we know p=10, we can solve the equation to be 80. Therefore, the correct answer is A. ALTERNATIVELY, you can guess the answer after finding the equation 10 = y + g. If you multiply this by 5 to sub into the last equation so you get 50 + 3p = ?, you can guess that the answer has to be lower than 90 (because if 2y + 2g + 2p = 40, then how can 3p = 40 for 50 + 3p = 90?). Since the only answer below 90 is A, the answer you will get is A. ",

Ageing is another fundamental factor for the development of cancer.
