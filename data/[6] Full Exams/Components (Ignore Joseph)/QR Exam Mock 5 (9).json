              "explanation": "If the diameter of the whole garden is 8m, the radius will be 4m. Thus the area of outer circle garden = 3.141875*4*4 = 50.27 sq metres. The circular fountain area = 3.141875*1.78*1.78 = 9.95471675… square metres. Therefore, the actual area of lawn he has in the garden to re-lawn would be 50.27 – 9.95471675… = 40.315… = 40.32 square metres. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",
