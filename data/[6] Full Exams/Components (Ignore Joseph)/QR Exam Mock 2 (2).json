Therefore the wood needed for the front of the house is 18 + 14 = 32m. The back will also be 32m. Since only 148m of wood is available, we have 148 – 32 – 32 = 84m for the length.

The space either side of the door is 2.5m wide, therefore you can only have 1 window on either side of the door, lengthways. In terms of height, since the wall is 4m tall, you could technically have 2 windows vertically on either side. However, there is a space on top of the door, meaning you could have 3 windows lengthways above the door height and then 2 windows next to the door on either side.
